# Refactoring challenges

Refactoring challenges is intended as a small collection of coding challenges that I used for
practicing refactoring best practices or other coding concepts.

Each challenge is in a separate Maven sub-module and contains a more detailed description in its own
submodule. Each module will contain the initial code and problem statement. For each challenge the
refactored code and notes taken during the refactoring process will be found in specific branches
mentioned bellow.
